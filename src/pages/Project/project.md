# In a nutshell

This project basically trying to be a simpler, Gatsby alternative.

Main difference being that instead of using GraphQL and many more complexities to handle your data, you put everything in the state or in the component using the hyperapp API and vanilla javascript.

It started out as a boilerplate but it made more sense to make a seperate package instead.

This site is just a demo to get the word out potentially some help and assistance.

The project is very early, it does not even have a name yet. Hypersite? Instasite? Hyperlite? Hyperlight? Dinglebop shleem? [Please help](https://github.com).

Let me know what you think on github or the hyperapp slack!

Feel free to open up [issues](https://github.com) if you see any possible improvements, ideas or pitfalls i'm not seeing. Pull requests will also be more than welcome!
